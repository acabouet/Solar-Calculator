# Solar-Calculator
A set of custom Drupal modules that when enabled together create a complete solar power sign up web app: users can see how much money they'd save each season by switching to solar power and sign up to switch to solar or be placed on a wait list. Energy company can export and download solar sign ups as an Excel spreadsheet.
